# Background & Context:
A group of friends are planning to open a training center in the Montreal area.
Their training center will consist of a gym and martial arts classes such as mma, juijitsu and the likes.

# Problematic:
One of the first and most important decisions to be made in order to set the project in motion is the choice of the location.
The questions to be answered are the following:
	- Where to open and what locations will be beneficial for such a project
	- Are there any aspects of the surrounding area that affect the success and popularity of training centers (proximity 
	to metro stations, proximity to parks, etc...)

# Steps/structure of the analysis:
Using the Foursquare API the following steps will be explored.
	1- A list of the existing training centers in the montreal area will be prepared.
	2- The ratings/likes count of these training centers as well as the surrounding venues of each training centers
	will be searched using the Foursquare API.
	3- Clusters of these training centers will be formed to explore any similarities of their surroundings
	4- Each cluster will be analyzed to explore the most common venues
	5- Using the ratings of the training centers and the clusters formed we will see which cluster groups most of the best
	rated training center
	6- Distances between training centers and some specific types of venues such as other gyms, gaz stations, metro stations,
	restaurants, etc will be computed using the latitudes and longitudes.
	Then these deistances will be plotted against the raitings and/or likes counts to see if there are any trends/effects 
	of the proximity on the popularity of these training centers.
